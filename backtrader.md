# Metrics
### Net Profit
Total profit that strategy generated through backtest during the whole time. 
- Does not consider draw down
- Does not allow relevant comparison between systems backtested over different periods of time. Annual Net Profit allows for comparison.
- Dependent on investment capital.

### % of Winning Trades 
Number of winning trades. 
- Very deceptive. Buy at random and wait for the first profit to sell. The system will have 100% winning trades but massive draw downs.
- More or less useless since the profit and loss is not considered.
